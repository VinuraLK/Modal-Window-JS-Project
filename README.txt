- I created this project to examine how modal windows work
- a modal window will be displayed when clicked on a button
- an overlay will be added when clicked on the button which will blur the backround around the modal window
- modal window will be closed when the close button on the modal window is clicked
- modal window will also be closed when clicked outisde of the modal window (AKA the overlay)
- carrying out both the steps above will also remove the overlay as well.
